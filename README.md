This project focuses on optimizing logistics for a company's expansion into a new market. By analyzing data on population, distances, and costs, the project aims to determine the optimal locations for warehouses and design efficient delivery routes. Using operations research techniques and software tools, the project will minimize costs while ensuring timely delivery to customers. Future enhancements will incorporate real-time data and customer feedback for continuous improvement. This project will enable the company to successfully enter the new market, providing reliable service and maximizing profitability.


Our logistics optimization problem is solved using the Clark-Wright Savings Algorithm, which efficiently minimizes travel costs by identifying the most cost-effective delivery routes. Additionally, we leverage the GAMsPy module with the Gurobi solver to optimize warehouse placement and vehicle routing, ensuring minimal costs and maximum operational efficiency. This combination allows us to solve large-scale logistics problems with precision and scalability.
